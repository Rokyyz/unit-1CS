## Reflection

# 1. What worked well?
* Learning and efficiently using the basics of coding
  * The use of CSV files, libraries, functions
* Being able to execute basic code keyword functions
  * input/output, for loops, if statements, while statements
* Learning to add custom things to the code
  * Color, fetching data
 
# 2. What did not work well?
* I asked for too much help from peers or seniors, and gave up too easily even though I had more in myself
* I was struggling with basic coding tasks, like in-class quizzes or even "snakify" exercises
  
# 3. What is your goal for unit 2?
* In general develop better coding skills
* Make my project documentation better
* Master flow charts
  * I still make some basic mistakes while making flow charts and it could look better

# 4. How do you plan on achieving that goal?
* Do more "snakify" quizzes, try to do tasks without help, do code wars in "CodinGame"
* Looking at feedback from 1st project and taking it into consideration going forward.
* Drawing more flowcharts for quizzes and projects, getting feedback, and improving on it.
