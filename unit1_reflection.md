## Reflection

# 1. What worked well?
* Learning and efficiently using the basics of coding
  * The use of CSV files, libraries, functions
* Being able to execute basic code keyword functions
  * input/output, for loops, if statements, while statements
* Learning to add custom things to the code
  * Color, fetching data
 
# 2. What did not work well?
* I asked for too much help from peers or seniors, gave up too easily even though I had more in myself
* I was stru

  
# 3. What is your goal for unit 2?
* To make my code less than 100 lines
  * My goal is to use functions to make my code more concise.
* Master flow charts
  * I still struggle to make flow charts so I want to be able to make them without looking at past flow charts.

# 4. How do you plan on achieving that goal?
* By using functions to prevent repetition
* I will continue to practice through daily quizzes
